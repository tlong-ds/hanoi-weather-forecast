We will code on this branch: `dev`.

- To switch to this branch `git checkout dev`
- To create a new branch: `git checkout -b dev2` (if you want to isolate to develop a new functionality without affecting other members)
- To remove a branch: `git branch -D dev2`

Do not:
- Code on `main` or `prod`.
- Push a buggy commit to the repo, other members will be affected.
- Ignore this file!
